The wind lasts for the spell\u2019s duration.\n\n* It deafens you and other creatures in its area.\n\n* It extinguishes unprotected flames in its area that are torch-sized or smaller.\n\n* The area is difficult terrain for creatures other than you.\n\n* The attack rolls of ranged weapon attacks have disadvantage if they pass in or out of the wind.\n\n* It hedges out vapor, gas, and fog that can be dispersed by strong wind.",
