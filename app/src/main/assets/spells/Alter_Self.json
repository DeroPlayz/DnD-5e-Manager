  "description": "You take on one of three physical adaptations: aquatic, appearance, or natural weapons.\n\nAquatic adaptations allow you to breathe underwater and swim as fast as you walk.\n\nAdapting your appearance can involve any of your natural physical features, even to that of another race, though your statistics stay the same and you cannot change your basic body structure.\n\nAnd you can grow fangs, claws, horns, or any other natural weapon you choose with the natural weapons adaptation. If you take the natural weapons adaptation, your unarmed strikes will then deal 1d6 damage of the most appropriate of bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. The natural weapon you grow is also magic and gives you a +1 bonus to both the attack rolls and damage you deal with it.",
