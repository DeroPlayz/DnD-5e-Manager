"description": "As you cast this spell, you use the rope to create a circle with a 5-foot radius on the ground or the floor. When you finish casting, the rope disappears and the circle becomes a magic trap.\nThis trap is nearly invisible, requiring a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be discerned.\nThe trap triggers when a Small, Medium, or Large creature moves onto the ground or the floor in the spell\u2019s radius. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be magically hoisted into the air, leaving it hanging upside down 3 feet above the ground or the floor. The creature is restrained there until the spell ends.\nA restrained creature can make a Dexterity saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Alternatively, the creature or someone else who can reach it can use an action to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the restrained effect ends.\nAfter the trap is triggered, the spell ends when no creature is restrained by it","duration": "8 hours","level": "1","name": "Snare","range": "Touch","ritual": false,"school": "abjuration","tags": ["artificer__eb_","druid","ranger","ranger__revised__","revised_ranger","fighter","rogue","wizard","level1"],
