"description": "A sphere encloses a Large or smaller creature or object. An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity save. On a failure, the creature is enclosed.\nNothing can pass through the barrier, though a creature in the sphere can breathe. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can't be affected by anything outside the sphere, nor can it affect anything outside in turn.\nThe sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object. An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere and roll it at up to half the creature's speed. The globe also can be picked up and moved by other creatures.\nA Disintegrate targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside.","duration": "Conc.
