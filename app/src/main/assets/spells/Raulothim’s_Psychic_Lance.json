    "description": "You unleash a shimmering lance of psychic power from your forehead at a creature that you can see within range. Alternatively, you can utter the creature\u2019s name. If the named target is within range, it gains no benefit from cover or invisibility as the lance homes in on it. If the named target isn\u2019t within range, the lance dissipates, and the spell slot is not expended. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take 10d6 psychic damage and be incapacitated until the start of your next turn",
