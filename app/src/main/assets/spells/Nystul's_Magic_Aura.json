If you cast this spell on the same target with the same effect every day for 30 days, the illusion lasts until it's dispelled.\n\n-False Aura: You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects that detect magical auras. You can make a nonmagical object appear magical and vice versa, or change an object's magical aura so that it appears to belong to a specific school. You can make the false magic apparent to any creature that handles the item.\n\n- Mask: You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects that detect creature types. You choose a creature type and other spells and magical effects treat the target as if it were a creature of that type or of that alignment.",
