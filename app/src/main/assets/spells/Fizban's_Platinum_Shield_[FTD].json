While surrounded by the field, a creature gains the following benefits:\n\n- Cover: The creature has half cover.\n\n- Damage Resistance: The creature has resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and poison damage.\n\n- Evasion: If the creature is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the creature instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.\n\nAs a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can move the field to another creature within 60 feet of the field.",
