If the object is in motion, you know the direction of its movement.\n\nThe spell can locate a specific object known to you, as long as you have seen it up close-\u2014within 30 feet-\u2014at least once. Alternatively, the spell can locate the nearest object of a particular kind, such as a certain kind of apparel, jewelry, furniture, tool, or weapon.\n\nThis spell can't locate an object if any thickness of lead, even a thin sheet, blocks a direct path between you and the object.",
