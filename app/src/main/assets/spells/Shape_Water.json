  "description": "* You instantaneously move or otherwise change the flow of the water as you direct, up to 5 feet in any direction. This movement doesn\u2019t have enough force to cause damage.\n\n* You cause the water to form into simple shapes and animate at your direction. This change lasts for 1 hour.\n\n* You change the water\u2019s color or opacity. The water must be changed in the same way throughout. This change lasts for 1 hour.\n\n* You freeze the water, provided that there are no creatures in it. The water unfreezes in 1 hour.\n\nIf you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.",
