The triggering creature must reroll the d20 and use the lower roll.\nYou can then choose a different creature you can see within range (you can choose yourself). The chosen creature has advantage on the next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw it makes within 1 minute. A creature can be empowered by only one use of this spell at a time.","duration": "Instantaneous","level": "1","name": "Silvery Barbs","range": "60 feet","ritual": false,"school": "enchantment","tags": ["bard","wizard","sorcerer","level1"],
