"description": "A burst of cold energy emanates from you in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d8 cold damage and is hindered by ice formations for 1 minute, or until it or another creature within reach of it uses an action to break away the ice. A creature hindered by ice has its speed reduced to 0. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't hindered by ice.","duration": "Instantaneous","level": "2","name": "Rime's Binding Ice","range": "30 feet","ritual": false,"school": "evocation","tags": ["wizard","sorcerer","level2"],
