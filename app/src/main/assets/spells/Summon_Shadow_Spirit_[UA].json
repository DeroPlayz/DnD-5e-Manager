  "description": "You call forth a shadowy spirit from the Shadowfell. The spirit manifests physically in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the Shadow Spirit stat block below. When you cast the spell, choose an emotion: Fury, Despair, or Fear. The creature physically resembles a misshapen humanoid marked by the chosen emotion, which also determines some of the traits in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.\n\nThe creature is friendly to you and your companions for the spell\u2019s duration. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don\u2019t issue any, it defends itself but otherwise takes no action",
