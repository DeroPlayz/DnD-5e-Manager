  "description": "You hide a chest and its contents on the Ethereal Plane. You must touch the chest and the miniature replica. The chest can contain up to 12 cubic feet of nonliving material.\n\nWhile the chest is on the Ethereal Plane, you can use an action to touch the replica and recall the chest. It appears in an unoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of you. You can send the chest back by using an action, touching both the chest and the replica.\n\nAfter 60 days, there is a cumulative 5 percent chance per day that the spell abruptly ends. This chance ends if you cast this spell again, if the smaller replica chest is destroyed, or if you choose to end the spell as an action. If the spell ends and the larger chest is on the Ethereal Plane, it is irretrievably lost.",
