For the duration, you can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon, and the weapon's damage die becomes a d8. The weapon also becomes magical, if it isn't already. The spell ends if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon.","duration": "1 minute","level": "cantrip","name": "Shillelagh","range": "Touch","ritual": false,"school": "Transmutation","tags": ["druid","cantrip"],
