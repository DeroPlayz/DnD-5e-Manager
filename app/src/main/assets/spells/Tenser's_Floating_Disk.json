    "description": "This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see. The disk remains for the duration and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends and everything falls to the ground.\n\nThe disk doesn't move if you're within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away, it follows you so that it remains within 20 feet. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can't cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more.\n\nIf you move more than 100 feet from the disk, the spell ends",
