It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven\u2019t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.\n\nOnce you have raged the number of times for your barbarian level, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.",
