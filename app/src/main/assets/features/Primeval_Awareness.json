      "description": "You have an innate ability to communicate with beasts and they see you as a kindred spirit. Through sounds and gestures you can communicate with beasts as an action, and can read its basic mood and intent. You learn its emotional state, whether it is affected by magic of any sorts, it's short term needs (like food or shelter) and actions you can take (if any) to persuade it not to attack. You cannot use this ability against a beast you have attacked in the last 10 minutes.\n\nAdditionally, you can attune your senses to determine if any of your favoured enemies lurk nearby. By spending 1 uninterrupted minute in concentration, as if you were concentrating on a spell, you can sense whether any favoured enemies are within 5 miles of you. This feature reveals which of your favoured enemies are present, their numbers, and the creatures general direction and distance (in miles) from you. If there are multiple groups of you favoured enemies within range, you learn this information for each of them. ",
