When you build your mechanical servant, you determine its\r\ngame statistics by selecting a chassis and a build, which you\rapply to the the mechanical servant statistics provided at the\rend of the Mechanist description. Your construct's chassis\rdetermines its general appearance, but it can look however\ryou like, as long as its form is appropriate for those statistics.\r\n\nThe construct has its own proficiency bonus which\rmatches your own. It increases in level whenever you do, and\rgains a new hit die, just as you do. Your servant may spend hit\rdice to heal duuring a short rest, however you must be\rpresent and able to make repairs.\r\n\nWhenever you gain an ability score increase\rfrom this class, your servant gains an ability score increase of\rits own, however the construct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Intelligence and Charisma\rscores cannot be increased through this feature.\r\n\nThe servant obeys your orders to the best of its ability. In\rcombat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own. Your\rmechanical servant can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t attack, but it can take other actions\ras normal.\r\n\nIf the servant is killed, it can be returned to life via normal\rmeans, such as with the revivify spell. In addition, over the\rcourse of a long rest, you can repair a slain servant if you\rhave access to its body. It returns to life with 1 hit point at the\rend of the rest.\r\n\nIf the servant is beyond recovery, you can reproduce the\rconstruct exactly as it was, with four days of work (eight\rhours each day) and 1,000 gp of raw materials",
