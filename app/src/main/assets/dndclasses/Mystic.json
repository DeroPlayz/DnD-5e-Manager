In addition, whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one discipline you know with a different one of your choice.\n\nUsing a Discipline:\nEach psionic discipline has several ways you can use it. The discipline specifies the type of action and number of psi points it requires. It also details whether you must concentrate on its effects, how many targets it affects, what saving throws it requires, and so on.\n\nPsychic Focus:\nThe Psychic Focus section of a discipline describes the benefit you gain when you choose that discipline for your psychic focus.\n\nEffect Options and Psi Points:\nA discipline provides different options for how to use it with your psi points. Each effect option has a name and the psi point cost of that option appears in parentheses. You must spend that number of psi points to use that option, while abiding by your psi limit. If you don't have enough psi points left, or the cost is above your psi limit, you can't use the option.\n\nSome options show a range rather than a specific cost. To use that option, you must spend a number of points within that range, abiding by your psi limit. Some options let you spend additional psi points to increase a discipline's potency. Again, you must abide by your psi limit, and you must spend all the points when you first use the discipline. Each option notes specific information about its effect, including any action required to use it and its range.\n\nComponents:\nDisciplines don't require the components that many spells require. Using a discipline requires no spoken words, gestures, or materials.\n\nDuration:\nAn effect option in a discipline specifies how long its effect lasts.\n\n- Instantaneous: If no duration is specified, the effect of the option is instantaneous.\n\n- Concentration: Some options require concentration to maintain their effects. This requirement is noted with \"conc.\", and is followed by the maximum duration of the concentration.\n\nConcentrating on a discipline follows the same rules as concentrating on a spell.\n\nTargets and Areas of Effect:\nPsionic disciplines use the same rules as spells for determining targets and areas of effect.\n\nSaving Throws and Attack Rolls:\nIf a discipline requires a saving throw, it specifies the type of save and the results of a successful or failed saving throw. The DC is determined by your psionic ability. Some disciplines require you to make an attack roll to determine whether the discipline's effect hits its target. The attack roll uses your psionic ability.\n\nCombining Psionic Effects:\nThe effects of different psionic disciplines add together while the durations overlap. However, a specific option from a psionic discipline doesn't combine with itself if the option is used multiple times. Instead, the most potent effect applies while the durations of the effects overlap.\n\nPsionics and spells are separate effects, and therefore their benefits and drawbacks overlap.

In addition, whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one discipline you know with a different one of your choice.\n\nUsing a Discipline:\nEach psionic discipline has several ways you can use it. The discipline specifies the type of action and number of psi points it requires. It also details whether you must concentrate on its effects, how many targets it affects, what saving throws it requires, and so on.\n\nPsychic Focus:\nThe Psychic Focus section of a discipline describes the benefit you gain when you choose that discipline for your psychic focus.\n\nEffect Options and Psi Points:\nA discipline provides different options for how to use it with your psi points. Each effect option has a name and the psi point cost of that option appears in parentheses. You must spend that number of psi points to use that option, while abiding by your psi limit. If you don't have enough psi points left, or the cost is above your psi limit, you can't use the option.\n\nSome options show a range rather than a specific cost. To use that option, you must spend a number of points within that range, abiding by your psi limit. Some options let you spend additional psi points to increase a discipline's potency. Again, you must abide by your psi limit, and you must spend all the points when you first use the discipline. Each option notes specific information about its effect, including any action required to use it and its range.\n\nComponents:\nDisciplines don't require the components that many spells require. Using a discipline requires no spoken words, gestures, or materials.\n\nDuration:\nAn effect option in a discipline specifies how long its effect lasts.\n\n- Instantaneous: If no duration is specified, the effect of the option is instantaneous.\n\n- Concentration: Some options require concentration to maintain their effects. This requirement is noted with \"conc.\", and is followed by the maximum duration of the concentration.\n\nConcentrating on a discipline follows the same rules as concentrating on a spell.\n\nTargets and Areas of Effect:\nPsionic disciplines use the same rules as spells for determining targets and areas of effect.\n\nSaving Throws and Attack Rolls:\nIf a discipline requires a saving throw, it specifies the type of save and the results of a successful or failed saving throw.
