You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds\nlong\n- The object continuously emits your choice of\nan odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away\n- A static visual effect appears on one of the\nobject's surfaces. This effect can be a picture,\nup to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a\nmixture of these elements, as you like.\n\nThe chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an\naction, you can touch the object and end the\nproperty early\n\nYou can give the magic of this feature to\nmultiple objects, touching one object each time you use the feature, and a single object can bear only one of the properties at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with the feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object).
