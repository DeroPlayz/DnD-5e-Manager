It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your companion acts on its own. \nWhen using your Natural Explorer feature, you and your animal companion can both move stealthily at a normal pace.\n\nYour animal companion has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your companion uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addition to the areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus, an animal companion also adds its proficiency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls.\nYour animal companion gains proficiency in two skills of your choice. It also becomes proficient with all saving throws.\nFor each level you gain after 3rd, your animal companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly.Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your companion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s abilities also improve. Your companion can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your companion can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t increasean ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise.\n\n",

You can have only one animal companion at a time.\nIf your animal companion is ever slain, the magical bond you share allows you to return it to life. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 25 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call  forth your companion's spirit and use your magic to create a new body for it. You can return an animal companion to life in this manner even if you do not possess any part of its body.
