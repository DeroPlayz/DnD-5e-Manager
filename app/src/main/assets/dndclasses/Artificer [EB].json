The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.\n- A static visual effect appears on one of the object's sur faces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.\n\nThe chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action. you can touch the object and end the property early. You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies.",

To Observers, you don't appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you look as if you're producing wonders using mundane items or out landish inventions.\n\nTOOLS REQUIRED\nYou produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus-specifically thieves' tools or some kind of artisan's tool-in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature.\nYou must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. After You gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.\n\nCANTRIPS\nYou know two cantrips of your choice from the artificer spell list. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice.\nWhen you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.\n\nPREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS\nYou have two 1st-level spell slots. To cast one of your artificer spells of Ist level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the artificer spell list. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\n\nSPELLCASTING ABILITY\nIntelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells: your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill.

The item you infuse serves as the creature's heart, around which the creature's body instantly forms.\n\nYou determine the homunculus's appearance. Some artificers prefer mechanical-looking birds, whereas some like winged vials or miniature, animate cauldrons.\n\nThe homunculus is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See this creature's game statistics in the Homunculus Servant stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus in several places.\n\nIn combat, the homunculus shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the homunculus can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.\n\nThe homunculus regains 2d6 hit points if the mending spell is cast on it. If you or the homunculus dies, it vanishes, leaving its heart in its space",
