The hound takes 5 force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.\n\n- At the start of its turn the hound automatically knows its target's location. If the target was hidden it is no longer hidden from the hound.\n\nThe hound appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of the target. Roll Initiative for the hound. On its turn it can only move toward its target by the most direct route and it can use its action only to attack its target. The hound can make opportunity attacks but only against its target. Additionally, while the hound is within 5 feet of its target the target has disadvantage on saving throws against any spell you cast. The hound disappears if it is reduced to 0 Hit Points, if its target is reduced to 0 Hit Points, or after 5 minutes",
