If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.\n\nThe glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.\n\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.\n\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don\u2019t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\n\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose *explosive runes* or a *spell glyph*.\n\n- Explosive Runes: When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature must make a Dexterity save. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failure (your choice when you create the glyph), or half damage on a success.\n\n- Spell Glyph: You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the triggering creature. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature.

The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or Resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a Sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the Duration. If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side).\n\nNothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can't be dispelled by Dispel Magic. A Disintegrate spell destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal Travel through the wall",
