It always obeys your commands, which you can give telepathically while it is within 100 feet of you. While the raven is perched on your shoulder, you gain darkvision with a range of 30 feet and a bonus to your passive Wisdom (Perception) score and to Wisdom (Perception) checks. The bonus equals your Charisma modifier.\n\n- While perched on your shoulder, the raven can't be targeted by any attack or other harmful effect; only you can cast spells on it; it can't take damage; and it is incapacitated.\n- You can see through the raven's eyes and hear what it hears while it is within 100 feet of you.\n- In combat, you roll initiative for the raven and control how it acts. If it is slain by a creature, you gain advantage on all attack rolls against the killer for the next 24 hours.\n- The raven doesn't require sleep. While it is within 100 feet of you, it can awaken you from sleep as a bonus action.\n- The raven vanishes when it dies, if you die, or if the two of you are separated by more than 5 miles. At the end of a short or long rest, you can call the raven back to you\u00e2\u20ac\u201dno matter where it is or whether it died\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand it reappears within 5 feet of you",
