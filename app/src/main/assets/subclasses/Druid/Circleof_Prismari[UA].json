Additionally, when you leave a space within 5 feet of a creature, you can force that creature to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone. A creature can be affected by the water only once each turn.\n\n- Scorching Whirl: Flames wreath your steps. Once before the end of your turn, you can force each creature within 5 feet of you to make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, a creature takes fire damage equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting modifier.\n\n- Thunderlight Jaunt: You take on a nimble lightning form. Until the end of your turn, you can move through the space of other creatures, and you do not provoke opportunity attacks. If you end your turn inside a creature's space, you are pushed into the nearest unoccupied space.\n\nYou can use a bonus action in this way a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest",
