Where life flourishes, stand against the forces that would render it barren.\n\n- Preserve Your Own Light: Delight in song and laughter, in beauty and art. If you allow the light to die in your own heart, you can't preserve it in the world.\n\n- Be the Light: Be a glorious beacon for all who live in despair.
