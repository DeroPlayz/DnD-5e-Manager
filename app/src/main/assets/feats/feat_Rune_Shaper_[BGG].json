      "description": "Prerequisites: Spellcasting Feature or Rune Carver\n\nYou've studied the magic of Giant runes, granting you the following benefits:\n\n- Comprehend Languages: You learn the comprehend languages spell. You can cast this spell without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a long rest before you can cast it in this way again. You can also cast this spell using any spell slots you have.\n\n- Rune Magic: You know a number of runes equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down), chosen from the Rune Spells table. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can inscribe each rune you know onto one nonmagical weapon, armor, piece of clothing, or other object you touch. You temporarily learn the 1st-level spells that correspond to the runes you inscribed, as specified on the Rune Spells table, and you know those spells until you finish a long rest, when the runes fade. While you are wearing or carrying any rune-marked object, you can cast the spells associated with those runes using any spell slots you have.\nYou can also invoke a rune inscribed on an object you are wearing or carrying and cast its associated spell without expending a spell slot or using material components. Once you cast the spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. Your spellcasting ability for this feat is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (choose when you select this feat).\nEach time you gain a level, you can replace one of the runes you know with another one from the Rune Spells table.\n\nRune --> Spell\nCloud --> Fog cloud\nDeath --> Inflict wounds\nDragon --> Chromatic orb\nEnemy --> Disguise self\nFire --> Burning hands\nFriend --> Speak with animals\nFrost --> Armor of Agathys\nHill --> Goodberry\nJourney --> Longstrider\nKing --> Command\nMountain --> Entangle\nStone --> Sanctuary\nStorm --> Thunderwave",
